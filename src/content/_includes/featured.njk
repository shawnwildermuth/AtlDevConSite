        <p class="lead">Measure Twice, Code Once</p>
        <p>Highly performant code is important, all the more so in our modern cloud-centric pay-per-cpu costing model. But given the ever-evolving nature of our industry, if the new coolness also efficient or just cool? I’ve been developing software as a consultant for over 20 years, focused on large distributed systems, and that has led me to some very clear opinions about where and how to measure performance, what trade-offs are worth it, and which are not. In this session you’ll learn what tools I use to evaluate performance, the areas of an application to focus on for performance, and how each of these interact with cloud-based hosting strategies of today.</p>

        <p class="lead">AI: Your Personal Intern</p>
        <p>
          Often, you'll find media narratives suggesting that AI is set to usurp your job. Indeed, the past year alone has witnessed a surge in AI capabilities, with some large-scale language models now solving a vast array of programming tasks in mere seconds. However, what if we shifted our mindset? Instead of considering AI as a job competitor, imagine it as a personal intern enhancing your programming efficiency. Throughout my 40-year journey in programming, I've seen various technologies, such as CASE and RAD tools, come and go. Many predicted these tools would eliminate the need for programmers. However, in each instance, these tools didn't replace us, but rather facilitated our work, freeing us to delve deeper into the creative aspects of our profession. In this session, I'll delve into the merits and limitations of the most recent AI tools. I'll guide you on how to utilize these tools to elevate your programming prowess. You'll understand firsthand why there's no need to fear AI. Instead, embrace it as a resourceful intern, taking care of the mundane and repetitive parts of programming, leaving you free to focus on the creative and nuanced aspects of transforming customer requirements into elegant software solutions.

        <p class="lead">Mapping the Path to Value: The missing piece of your Agile-DevOps transition</p>
        <p>Value Streams have been a core of Lean thinking for decades. It started with Toyota and the Lean Manufacturing movement and has been widely embraced since then. An understanding of this concept for modern product development is key to improving our ways of working – being more effective, efficient, and holistic in our approach to delivering value to customers. Many companies struggle with sub-optimization by focusing on a small portion of the production pipeline. Instead, let’s make visible and look to measure the end to end system. Mapping the path to value will tell us: Do we really need to hire more engineers in one area of the business; or would we benefit by hiring somewhere else? Is our biggest challenge actually the time it takes to deploy code from first check-in? Let‘s understand the entire path to production and the capabilities needed so we are hiring to improve the entire system capability - organizing around value delivery. Bring your laptop or notebook to the session - at the end, you’ll try to map out your own "path to value.” In this session, you will learn: - Why mapping the path to value is crucial to helping your business achieve the promised value of agile and DevOps- How to determine the scope of your mapping activity - How to get started with the mapping activity in a lightweight way</p>
