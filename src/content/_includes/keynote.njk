              <p class="lead">While some development can be done in silos, we often need to reach out to discover alternative ways to solve the problems we face or communicate with people that have more knowledge of the systems. As humans, we also need to build our own personal community of peers and mentors in order to thrive and grow.</p>
              <br />
              <p class="lead">For our keynote, we reflect on what we've learned over the past 20 years of running the Atlanta Developers' Conference (aka Atlanta Code Camp) and how it has impacted our technical abilities, careers, and the friends we've met along the way. We'll also offer some suggestions on how to best take advantage of the opportunities for you during the conference and the benefits of getting more involved.</p>
